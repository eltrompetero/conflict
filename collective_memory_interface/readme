interface_data.p is a Python pickle containing the data used for "Collective
memory in primate conflict implied by temporal scaling collapse" by Lee et al.
published in J. R. Soc. Interface (2017). 

The duration of peaceful periods in chronological order is contained in the
pandas.DataFrame "peacedf" and the conflict size and durations are in
"fightdf". These can be loaded in python with the following code:

>>>>>>>
import pandas as pd
import pickle

data = pd.load(open('interface_data.p','rb'))
peacedf,fightdf = data['peacedf'],data['fightdf']

Flack (jflack@santafe.edu).
